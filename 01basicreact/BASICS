1) 
Why to learn React? it's a famous js library it makes easy to manage and build complex frontend.

2) 
Before React, there was no automatic sync between JavaScript data and the DOM (the visible webpage).
Developers had to manually update the DOM whenever data changed.
This manual process was error-prone — easy to forget, miss updates, or get out of sync.
That caused problems like phantom messages, wrong notification counts, or leftover UI elements.

React solves this by:
Keeping the UI automatically synced with the data (state).
When your data changes, React re-renders only the parts that need updating, so the DOM always matches your latest data.
You don’t update the DOM directly anymore — React does it for you.
